# MITRE-ATTACK-Threat-Hunting-APT-Overlap-Analysis
MITRE ATT&amp;CK Threat Hunting &amp; APT Overlap Analysis

This project demonstrates how MITRE ATT&CK, threat intelligence tools, and behavioral analysis can be combined to support threat-informed defense. By identifying overlapping techniques across multiple APT groups, analysts can prioritize detections that address the most common adversary behaviors.
This approach strengthens SOC operations, reduces alert fatigue, and improves threat readiness.
